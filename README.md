# Join me on my journey to learn React.js

## Purpose

This repository is dedicated to learning the React.js framework along with TailwindCSS via project-based learning, in this case, making a movie streaming web app, with my background of pure HTML, CSS and Javascript. I aim to learn the ins-and-outs of React.js, especially the fundamentals.
